<h1>Ferret API</h1>
<p>A RESTful API for grabbing fast-loading images of ferrets.</p>

<p>(Want a business of ferrets? Check out the <a href="ferret_api/business">business dump</a>!)</p>

<p>Also, I may or may not have gotten to the actual API part there. If you still want to wait, remind me or check this out on <a href="https://github.com/LeoDog896/ferret_api">github!</a></p>
